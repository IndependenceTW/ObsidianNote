## What teacher said?

Software development is not easy at all. Some people thought that developing an application is just calling a set of functions, and then, a convenient software product can be on the market. However, there are lots of tricks and techniques that you need to know for software development. For example, you need to care about software reusability because you may use the code of this product in some other product. In the other words, the developing product may need some pieces of the feature in previous software. At that moment, reusability is important. You need to guarantee the product won't be crashed when adding this feature. Software maintainability is also important. For a general physical product,  if the product has some disadvantages or some bugs, what we do is just redesign the product; however, for a software product, we need to fix the product based on the previous code. All these concepts above can be concluded in a small concept. That is code quality. A good code quality needs to be easy to read and know. Without the readability of code, it is going to be inefficient to reuse, rewrite or even maintain the software product. To sum up, the essence of software development is code quality. 


## My opinion
It is hard for nowadays computer science students to learn how to code a high-quality program because there are lots of subjects, including computer organization, algorithms, operation systems, and so on. The only way we learn how to code well is based on homework. We can code our program homework in a readable way, rather than quickly solve the question.
